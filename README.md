## Features

* **Start Screen:** Presents a clean starting page with a "Start Quiz" button to begin the challenge.
* **Dynamic Questions:** Utilizes the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/) to retrieve a set of multiple-choice questions for each quiz session.
* **Question Display:** Clearly shows the current question number (e.g., "Question 3 of 10"), the question text, and four potential answers.
* **Interactive Answering:**
    * Allows users to click on an answer choice.
    * Highlights the selected answer.
    * Prevents selecting another answer for the same question once one is chosen.
* **Answer Shuffling:** Randomizes the display order of the four answer options for each question.
* **Controlled Navigation:** The "Next" button is initially disabled and only becomes active after the user selects an answer, ensuring user interaction before proceeding.
* **Results Page:** After answering all questions, displays the user's final score (e.g., "You scored 7 out of 10").
* **Replayability:** Includes a "Play Again" button on the results page, which resets the application state and allows the user to start a new quiz immediately.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts for optimal viewing and interaction across different devices and screen sizes.
